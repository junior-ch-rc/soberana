# soberana ðŸ‘‘

An ontology for describing an International Data Spaces Ecosystem from three different perspectives: Sovereignty, Legitimacy and Economic.

# Goal

Present a basic conceptual model of the IDS domain and provide the user with a view on aspects of data sovereignty, participants' legitimacy and the economic agreement for exchanging data within these spaces. With the ontology, it should be possible to instantiate IDS organization models according to the RAM-IDSA parameters, as well as recover information that allows the analysis of the three aspects mentioned.

# Scope

The ontology is aimed at modeling forms of IDS organization with its basic components focusing only on economic, data sovereignty and legitimacy aspects. Its level of detail is directly related to the competency questions.

# Implementation Language

Implemented using OntoUML and serilized in OWL with ProtegÃ© 5.x.

# Use Cases

- Assist in the development or analysis of business models in IDS;
- Allow understanding of the value proposition of IDS under the aspects of data sovereignty, legitimacy and economic agreement;
- Serve as a reference model for developing software for IDS or graphical modeling of IDS.
